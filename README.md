This was my required Classrom Project on 'FoodHub Data Analysis' that i completed. 
Our tasks involved:

Exploring the dataset: Identifying the types of data available, such as customer details, order information, and restaurant characteristics.
Performing data analysis: Using statistical techniques to find patterns, trends, and relationships in the data that could answer the key questions.
Addressing business questions: Providing insights on which restaurants had higher demand, identifying popular cuisine types, peak ordering times, and factors affecting order volume.
The results of this analysis aimed to guide the company in making data-driven decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and boost business growth.
